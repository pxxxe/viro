/**
 * Viro React Native - New Architecture Direct Import
 *
 * This entry point provides access to Viro components that are compatible with
 * React Native's New Architecture (Fabric). All components now use direct
 * Fabric integration without an interop layer.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * import { ViroARScene, Viro3DObject } from '@reactvision/react-viro/fabric';
 * ```
